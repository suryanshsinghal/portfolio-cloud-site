# 🌐 AWS Static Portfolio Website (S3 + CloudFront)

## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates a **production-grade deployment of a static website** using AWS cloud services.

The goal was to build a system that is:

* Fast (low latency globally)
* Secure (HTTPS + restricted access)
* Scalable (serverless architecture)
* Highly available

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Traditional hosting methods often suffer from:

* High latency for global users
* Limited scalability
* Complex infrastructure management
* Lack of built-in security

The objective was to design a **cloud-native solution** that solves these issues efficiently.

---

## 💡 Solution Architecture

The system uses AWS services to deliver optimized performance:

* **Amazon S3** → Stores static website files
* **AWS CloudFront** → Global CDN for fast delivery
* **Origin Access Control (OAC)** → Restricts direct S3 access
* **HTTPS** → Secure content delivery

### 🔁 Flow

1. User requests website via CloudFront
2. Cached content served from nearest edge location
3. If not cached → request forwarded to S3
4. Response cached for future requests

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

* Serverless deployment (no backend servers)
* Global CDN distribution
* Secure access using OAC
* Optimized caching strategies
